i made this website to showcase my stuff and create blogs and stuff, but i also just wanted to have fun
w/ making it too.

i [love]{class="text-error"} writing software, creating websites and architecting ui. creating things that other ppl (and me) can use is just something i love doing.

in my free time, i like to:

- play [games](/games) (mainly fps and arcade shooters, open world rpg's, and roblox ofc)
- listen to [music](/music) (im a rocker)
- code (obviously xD), whether its a new project or updating my existing [projects](/projects)
- i like hanging out w/ my friends, irl and online
- i enjoy the outdoors, exploring new places, biking, as well as going on hikes and walks (yes, i do go outside)

**fun fact about me:** i LOVE arizona iced tea, like omg its so good. my favorites are sweet tea, peach tea, half n half and lemon tea. KEEP ARIZONA IN BUSINESS PLS, AND PLS KEEP IT 99Â¢!
